The following directory contains files relating to the creation of driver drowsiness detection mobile application. The directory is part of the implementation phase for academic purposes. 

The following technologies were used in the creation of the application:
  -Jupyter Notebook
  -Dart
  -HTML 
  -Flutter
  
The main application is held in the sub-dirctory titled "flutter_app."

In order to view the source code of the application flutter is required. 

An important thing to keep in mind is when running the main dart file within the "flutter_app" directory the following error message may appear:
"The plugin `tflite` uses a deprecated version of the Android embedding.
To avoid unexpected runtime failures, or future build failures, try to see if this plugin supports the Android V2 embedding. Otherwise, consider removing it since a future release of Flutter will remove these deprecated APIs."

However, do not worry as it is merely a cautionary step by the Flutter application framework and the necessary changes to dependencies and AndroidManifest.xml files have been made. The application can still run even though the above error is shown.

Any and all further instructions have been written within the Readme.md file inside the "flutter_app" directory
